# fs-atomic

> Safer filesystem operations.

## Why?

 - Protects you from race conditions.
 - Protects you from making some security mistakes.
 - Automatically creates nested directories as needed.
 - Always overwrites, avoiding `EEXIST` errors.

## Install

```sh
npm install fs-atomic --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const fsAtomic = require('fs-atomic');
```

Create nested directories.

```js
fsAtomic.mkdir('nonexisting/thing', 'another/one').then(() => {
    console.log('Directories created.');
});
```

Create a symlink.

```js
fsAtomic.symlink('mytarget', '/my/dest').then(() => {
    console.log('Symlinking complete.');
});
```

Write a file.

```js
fsAtomic.writeFile('myfile', 'some data').then(() => {
    console.log('Write complete.');
});
```
